I'm a Software Engineer looking for a new full-stack software engineering role. I've written my resume as an HTML webpage. Please flag any spelling, grammar, wording, flow, clarity, or other issues.

To flag an issue, print out where it is, the line, then describe what needs to change.  For example, to flag a spelling error you might print (without the indentation):

    Under the job Shmeppy:
        Founded the modstly successful SaaS product
   
        Spelling Error: Should be spelled \"modestly\".

Place general issues in a separate section, for example:

    General issues:
        * Education should be last.
        * The page count is too long.

If you do not find any problems, print only:

    No errors found.

Everything that follows is the resume's HTML:
