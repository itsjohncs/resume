I'm a Software Engineer looking for a new full-stack software engineering role. I've written my resume as an HTML webpage. Please look through it and flag any spelling or grammar errors.

Only flag egregious grammar errors. There is another review process that handles stylistic and higher-level issues. You are just ensuring that no blatant errors make it into the resume.

To flag a problem, print out where it is, the line, then describe what needs to change. For example, to flag a spelling error you might print (without the indentation):

    Under the job Shmeppy:
        Founded the modstly successful SaaS product
   
        Spelling Error: Should be spelled \"modestly\".

If you do not find any problems, print only:

    No errors found.

Everything that follows is the resume's HTML:
